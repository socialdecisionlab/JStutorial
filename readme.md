# Welcome to my web-based experiments with JS tutorials!
I created these tutorials as part of my 'Neuroeconomics' course at the department of cognitive sciences at the University of Haifa. The materials available here are five presentations (in English) and source code for three hands-on tutorials. At some point videos of the lectures (in Hebrew) may be uploaded here.
## Lectures Slides
 1. Introduction - experimental design for the web.
 2. Online tools - a short survey of some of the online tools available for building web-based experiments.
 3. Tutorial 1 - Two arms bandit task (static environment, stochastic outcome)
 4. Tutorial 2 - Saving data to the server (php, sql)
 5. Tutorial 3 - Risk and Ambiguity task (random trials, questionnaire)
## Source Files
 1. Two arms bandit experiment
 2. Two arms bandit with server side scripts
 3. Risk and ambiguity experiment with server side scripts and questionnaire json
## How to use
 Do not use these material commercially.
 Acknowledgment (with a link to the lab website) will be nice.
 Feedback will be very helpful.
 # Videos in Hebrew
 I presented these tutorials in my course, and the videsos (Hebrew) are available here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rkjrc19JEOa9CZF-9AZ2HkFiu_MD_u-K?usp=sharing
